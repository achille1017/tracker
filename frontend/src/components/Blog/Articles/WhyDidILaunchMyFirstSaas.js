                <p className='textArticle'>To succeed, a SaaS needs to address a problem. I was personally lacking in productivity when I watched a video about time management. I discovered habit tracking and wanted an app that would exactly meet my needs.</p>
                <p className='textArticle'>I've always struggled to assess my productivity level and whether it was decreasing or increasing. Although I tried to establish positive routines to become the best version of myself, distractions often led me back to my old demons of procrastination.</p>

                <h2 className='h2Article'>Resolve a problem</h2>
                <p className='textArticle'>When I discovered the SaaS business, I immediately wanted to dive in. As a web application developer for over two years, the idea seemed perfect to me: develop software and sell access to it through a subscription model. After researching the best practices for a successful SaaS, I understood that a SaaS must solve a problem. How to find a problem to solve? I had one. Managing my time and tracking my productivity progress. I designed <span className='withArcoP'>With Arco</span> to meet exactly my needs, and I am its first user.</p>
                <p className='textArticle'>The SaaS business model appealed to me because of its recurring revenue structure and scalability. By creating a cloud-based software solution, I could potentially build a loyal customer base and generate predictable monthly income. This model also allows for continuous improvement and updates to the software without the need for users to manually install new versions. <strong>So feel free to suggest any features you would like.</strong>  My experience as a web developer gave me the technical skills to create the software, but I realized that understanding the business aspects of SaaS was equally important. I focused on addressing a specific pain point - time management and productivity tracking - which is a common challenge for many professionals and businesses.</p>

                        <p className='textArticle'>Launching this SaaS was a new way for me to test my experience as a web developer. It's the first time I've used the OpenAI API, and I didn't expect using this technology to be so captivating. The power of artificial intelligence for text generation seems infinite to me. If this SaaS appeals to you and convinces you of my skills in terms of software development, send me an email and let's discuss how we could work together on your project.</p>

                        <p className='textArticle'>Utilizing Reddit: I actively participated in relevant subreddits (r/SaaS, r/ProductivityApps, r/developpeurs) to connect with potential users and gather feedback. By sharing insights about my product and engaging with the community, I built credibility and interest. Reddit's unique platform allowed me to tap into discussions about productivity and time management, directly reaching my target audience. <a href='https://www.reddit.com/user/AchilleDev/'>Check my reddit.</a></p>

I prepared a compelling listing that showcased the features of my app, ensuring it stood out among other products. Engaging with the community before and during the launch day helped generate excitement. I encouraged friends and early supporters to upvote and share their thoughts, which significantly boosted visibility. <a href='https://www.producthunt.com/posts/with-arco'>Check the product.</a></p>

                        <p className='textArticle'>Expanding to Content Creation:  Even if was a little bit shy at the beggining, I had to recognize the importance of ongoing engagement, I began creating content on Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. These platforms allowed me to share tips on productivity, demonstrate my app's features, and connect with a broader audience. By providing valuable content, I aim to establish myself as a real influencer while driving traffic back to my SaaS. </p>
